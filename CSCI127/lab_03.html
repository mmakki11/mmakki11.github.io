        Gradescope, and Blackboard.
      </p>

      <h3 id="colors">Colors</h3>

      <p>
        There are several different ways to specify colors. We will use colors:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>by name,</li>
        <li>by percentage,</li>
        <li>by absolute amount of color (`255’ mode), and</li>
        <li>by absolute amount of color (hexadecimal format).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="names-for-colors">Names for Colors</h4>

      <p>
        For common colors, you can give the name of the color, as a string. For
        example, run the program (click the triangle) to see two turtles,
        drawing in different colors:
      </p>

        marginwidth="0"
        marginheight="0"
        allowfullscreen=""
      ></iframe>
      <p><br /></p>

      <p>
        There are more than 100 colors that we can use by name. Here are the
        ones available in most web browsers and Python turtle packages:
      </p>

      <iframe
        src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#X11_color_names"
        width="100%"

        marginwidth="0"
        marginheight="0"
        allowfullscreen=""
      ></iframe>
      <p><br /></p>

      <p>
        Some are obvious, like (“red” or “blue”), others are a bit more obscure
        (like “mediumorchid” or “chartreuse”). What color is “mediumorchid”?
        Change the color of one of the turtles in the coding window above to
        find out. Add in a new turtle and make it your favorite color. Draw a
        few lines to demonstrate its color.
      </p>

      <h4 id="colors-by-decimals">Colors by Decimals</h4>

      <p>
        As we saw above, the turtle package recognizes many common colors by
        name. If your favorite color is not on that list, you can make a new
        color by specifying how much of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red">red</span>,
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green">green</span>, and
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">blue</span> (‘RGB’) light
        intensity you would like. The range for each is from 0 (no light) to 255
        (100% light). For example, if all the light intensities are 255 (100% of
        the possible), then the color is white.
      </p>

      <p>
        Read the code below and guess what color each turtle is. Check your
        guess by running the program:
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s look at some of the shades of red that are available. Here’s our
        plan (or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>):
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Create a turtle, tess.</li>
        <li>For 10, 20, 30, …, 250,</li>
        <li>Move forward 10 steps</li>
        <li>Make the turtle a bit larger each time</li>
        <li>Make the turtle a bit more red each time</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Let’s change each piece of our “To Do” list into Python code:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Create a turtle, tess.</p>

          <p>
            We’ve done this before. We import the turtle module and set up the
            turtle. One new thing we need to do, is to tell the turtle library
            that we would like to represent colors as decimal numbers:
          </p>

          <p>#A program that demonstrates the shades of red</p>

          <p>import turtle #Import the turtle drawing package</p>

          <p>
            turtle.colormode(255) #Allows colors to be given as 0…255 tess =
            turtle.Turtle() #Create a turtle
          </p>

          <p>
            To keep our drawing from running off the screen, we’ll move tess
            backwards before we start our loop:
          </p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre
                class="highlight"
              ><code>tess.backward(100)		#Move her backwards, to give more space to draw
</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For 10, 20, 30, …, 250,</p>

          <p>
            This can be done with a for-loop and a range that starts at 10,
            stops at 255, and steps up by 10 each time:
          </p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre class="highlight"><code>for i in range(0,255,10):
</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Move forward 10 steps</p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre class="highlight"><code>	tess.forward(10)		#Move forward  
</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make the turtle a bit larger each time</p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre
                class="highlight"
              ><code>	tess.pensize(i)		#Set the drawing size to be i (larger each time)   
</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make the turtle a bit more red each time</p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre
                class="highlight"
              ><code>	tess.color(i,0,0)		#Set the red channel to be i (brighter each time)    
</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Here’s the whole program altogether. Copy it over to an idle file window
        and try running it:
      </p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code>#A program that demonstrates the shades of red

import turtle				#Import the turtle drawing package

turtle.colormode(255)		#Allows colors to be given as 0...255
tess = turtle.Turtle()		#Create a turtle
tess.shape("turtle")		#Make it turtle shaped
tess.backward(100)			#Move her backwards, to give more space to draw

#For 0,10,20,...,250
for i in range(0,255,10):
     tess.forward(10)		#Move forward
     tess.pensize(i)		#Set the drawing size to be i (larger each time)
     tess.color(i,0,0)		#Set the red channel to be i (brighter each time)    
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The resulting graphics window is:</p>

      <p><img src="images/shadesOfRed.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>
        How would you show shades of green? When you have figured out the
        answer, see the <a href="assignments.html">Programming Problem List</a>.
      </p>

      <h4 id="colors-by-hexadecimal">Colors by Hexadecimal</h4>

      <p>
        A common way to represent colors is using hexadecimal numbers. Our
        traditional decimal, or base-10 numbers, use 10 symbols for each digit:
        0, 1, 2, 3, …, 9. Hexadecimal, or base-16 numbers, use 16 symbols. In
        addition to 0, 1, 2, …, 9, the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F are also
        used.
      </p>

      <p>
        A good way to think about it is to think about what the world would be
        like if everyone had 8 fingers on each hand, instead of 5. When we
        count, on 10 fingers, we can use the symbols 0, 1, 2, …, 9 to label each
        finger:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/hands10.png" alt="" /><br />
        (from
        <a href="http://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/478-hexadecimal.html"
          >i-programmer.info</a
        >)
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing the same for 16 fingers, we use 0, 1, 2, …, 9, and then A, B, …, E
        when we run out of the normal symbols for numbers:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/hands16.png" alt="" /><br />
        (from
        <a href="http://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/478-hexadecimal.html"
          >i-programmer.info</a
        >)
      </p>

      <p>
        The first 9 numbers are the same in both decimal and hexadecimal, but
        larger numbers are different. For example, counting to 10 on our
        8-fingered hands gives the symbol A. So, the decimal number 10 is the
        single digit hexadecimal number, A.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going in the other direction, the hexadecimal number 11, is counting
        through all the (8-fingered hands) fingers (16) plus one more, yielding
        17.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why does this matter? Our color values range in decimal from 0 to 255.
        If we write these in hexadecimal, the range is 0 to FF. FF is the
        largest two-digit hexadecimal number, so, this range of values fits
        perfectly in two-digit hexadecimal numbers. Triples of these hexadecimal
        values are an extremely common way to represent colors.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, here are some shades of blue, given with their name and
        hexadecimal value:
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hex.asp"
          ><img src="images/blues.png" alt=""
        /></a>
      </p>

      <p>
        The leading hash sign (‘#’) is used to indicate that this is a
        hexadecimal number:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The next two digits are for the amount of red.</li>
        <li>The middle two digits are for the amount of green.</li>
        <li>The last two digits are for the amount of blue.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The first color on the list has 00 or 0% red, 00 or 0% green, and 00 or
        0% red, and represents the color black. These shades of blue all have no
        red (first two digits are 00) and no green (middle two digits are 00).
        By varying the values of the last two digits, we have a dark, navy blue
        (80 in the last two digits) to a bright blue (FF in the last two
        digits).
      </p>

      <p>
        We can set the color of turtles using hexcodes. For example, to create a
        turtle, named thea, and set her color to the medium blue (using the hex
        code from the above list), we can:
      </p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>import turtle

thea = turtle.Turtle()
thea.shape("turtle")
thea.color("#0000CD")
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>producing a graphics window with:</p>

      <p><img src="images/medBlueTurtle.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>
        The code above always produces a medium blue turtle. How would you
        modify the program to let the user specify a hex code for the color of
        the turtle? When you have figured out the answer, see the
        <a href="assignments.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

      <p>
        If you own a windows machine download and install <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">git bash</a> to be able to follow along, otherwise you may use the terminal application available on your Mac system.
      </p>
      <p>  
        The terminal has its own set of commands (separate from Python) that we
        can use to communicate with the operating system. It’s often called the
        <strong>command line interface</strong> or shell. It predates the
        graphical interface that is now available and is incredibly useful for
        automating tasks and working on remote servers. We will slowly introduce
        shell commands over the course of the semester and eventually
        incorporate them into some programming assignments.
      </p>

      <p>
         When you type:

          <pre class="highlight"><code>idle
          </code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        you are asking the operating system to launch the program idle3. The
        laptop was configured to first look in folders containing applications,
        and then to check your home folder, and then to check the current folder
        you are using to find an application by that name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s create a new <strong>directory</strong>, or folder, to hold your
        images (using the shell or command line). Where it says thomasH below,
        replace with your name. It is easier if you avoid spaces in the names:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Open a new terminal window (go to the upper left menu icon, search for
          terminal and click, or if you already have terminal, you can click on
          its menu to create a new window).
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the terminal window, type:</p>

          <p>To add a new directory, we type:</p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir thomasH
</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            (replace thomasH with your name to create a directory for you!).
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, when we list the current directory, we should new item (namely
            the directory with your name):
          </p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre class="highlight"><code>ls
</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Let’s change directories:</p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre class="highlight"><code>cd thomasH
</code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            If we ask for a listing (ls), we will now see the contents of your
            directory.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The graphical interface and shell are operating on the same underlying
        system, so, changes you make with one can be seen by the other. If you
        open up the file icon (on left hand menu bar) and click the Home
        directory, you will see the folder you just created.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next lab, we will explain how to copy and move files between
        directories.

      <h3 id="images">Images</h3>

      <p>
        There are many different formats to store images. Some store the
        information about the color of every <em>pixel</em> (“picture element”
        or dot on the screen). Others store end points of lines or boundaries of
        regions and the colors of each. We focus on the former, and in
        particular, use the png (portable network graphics) file format, which
        is popular for storing images captured from cameras and is `lossless’
        (every pixel captured is stored, so, can also be quite large).
      </p>

      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/MoreAboutIteration/2DimensionalIterationImageProcessing.html"
          >textbook</a
        >
        has a lovely visualization and explanation:
      </p>

      <p><img src="images/thinkGrid.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>
        To specify a given pixel, you give its row, r, and column, c, in the
        grid. Counting from the upper left hand corner which has index 0,0. This
        is unlike standard Cartesian (math) coordinates but echos how matrices
        are often accessed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img align="right" src="images/sic-imageplanes.png" /> Each pixel is
        represented by its the percentage of red, green, and blue (“RGB”)
        values. Images are stored as a grid of red values, a grid of green
        values, and a grid of blue values.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if we stored our image in the variable,
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">img</code>, we could
        access the red value by:
      </p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>print "Upper left has red:", img[0,0,0]
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>and the amount of green:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>print "Upper left has green:", img[0,0,1]
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>and the amount of blue:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>print "Upper left has blue:", img[0,0,2]
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Any point can be accessed via its coordinates (i,j) and the color
        channel (0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for blue). In our example above,
        with the picture stored in the variable, img:
      </p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>img[r,c,chan]
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        where the r is the row and c is the column of the pixel and chan is the
        color channel (0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for blue). Note that when
        we are accessing parts of our images, we use the square brackets (‘[’
        and ‘]’), just as we did for lists. The round parenthesis (‘(‘ and ‘)’)
        are used for functions (like
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print()</code> and
        <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">right())</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s write a program that manipulates an image. Read through the code
        first, and then try on your computer. What does it do? Note: this
        program assumes that you have a file called
        <a href="images/csBridge.png">csBridge.png</a> in the same directory.
        You can use that file, or substitute one of your own.
      </p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>#Name:  CSci 127 Teaching Staff
#Date:  Fall 2021
#This program loads an image, displays it, and then creates, displays,
#    and saves a new image that has only the red channel displayed.

#Import the packages for images and arrays:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import numpy as np

img = plt.imread('csBridge.png')   #Read in image from csBridge.png
plt.imshow(img)		           #Load image into pyplot
plt.show()                         #Show the image (waits until closed to continue)

img2 = img.copy()        #make a copy of our image          
img2[:,:,1] = 0          #Set the green channel to 0
img2[:,:,2] = 0          #Set the blue channel to 0 

plt.imshow(img2)         #Load our new image into pyplot
plt.show()               #Show the image (waits until closed to continue)

plt.imsave('reds.png', img2)  #Save the image we created to the file: reds.png
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The code above always produces an image with only the red channel
        displayed. How would you modify the program to display only the green
        channel? When you have figured out the answer, see the
        <a href="assignments.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

      <p>
        If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on
        the programming problems due early next week. There’s instructors to
        help you, and you already have Python up and running. The
        <a href="assignments.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem
        descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.

      <p>
        Today’s lab introduced several packages that are freely available but do
        not always come bundled with Python. If you are using anaconda,
        then most are included. See the directions below for other
        installations. (To install Python, see
        <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for directions as well as <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html">matplotlib installation if needed</a>  for more information)
