    <h2 id="lab-1">LAB 1</h2>

    <p>
      Today’s lab will focus on using the gradescope &amp; Blackboard systems
      and simple programs in Python.
    </p>

    <p>
      Software tools needed: web browser and Python IDLE programming
      environment.
    </p>


    <h3 id="using-blackboard">Using Blackboard</h3>

    <p>
      This course will use the on-line Blackboard system for in-class quizzes
      and posting grades. Blackboard should be accessible through your CUNY
      First account (see Hunter
      <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/it/blackboard/blackboard-information-page">ICIT Blackboard page</a>
      for directions on using the system and how to get help).
    </p>

    <p>
      Quizzes are done via the Content menu (left hand side of Home screen).
      I will provide the password for the quiz.
    </p>



    <h3 id="in-class-quiz">In-class Quiz</h3>

    <p>
      During lab, there is a quiz on the academic integrity policy of City
      University of New York. The password to access the quiz will be given
      during lab. To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard.
    </p>

    <h3 id="using-python-on-your-computer">Using Python on Your Computer</h3>

    <p>
      The Python programming language and IDLE environment are freely
      available for many platforms from
      <a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a> or
      <a href="https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/#detailed-installation-information">Anaconda</a>. For this
      class, we are using <strong>Python 3</strong>. Many features of the
      language (including the syntax of print statements) changed between the
      second and third version, so, you must use the Python 3 for submitting
      programs.
    </p>



    <p>
      If you have a Mac or Windows computer, the easiest installation is
      <a href="https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/#detailed-installation-information">Anaconda</a>. When given
      the choice, choose to “Install for me only” (this avoids
      some odd permission problems that occur when choosing the install for
      everyone).
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost all the packages we will use are automatically included in the
      Anaconda default installation. The two that are not, image and folium,
      can be installed later. We won’t need these
      immediately, so, you can wait on installing them.
    </p>


  </div>

  <h3 id="using-python">Using Python</h3>

  <p>
    We will be using the IDLE programming environment for Python, since it
    is very simple and comes with all distributions of Python
  </p>

  <p>To launch IDLE:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Search for IDLE on your machine, then open it
    </li>
    <li>A new window will launch for IDLE.</li>
    <li>
      <p>To see that it works, type at the IDLE prompt:</p>
      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>print("Hello, World!")
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    let’s use a text window, where we can save our program for later and
    submit it to Gradescope (this is the basis of the first program).
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      First, open up a text window: on the menu bar, choose “File” and from
      that menu, choose “New File”.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In that window, type:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>#Name:  ...your name here...
#Date: January 30, 2021
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Save the program (using the “Save” under the “File” menu). When you
      save it, name it something that you will be remember for the future
      and end it in .py. For example, ps1.py.
    </li>
    <li>Run your program (using the “Run Module” from the “Run” menu).</li>
    <li>
      If it prints “Hello, World!” to the screen, then log into Gradescope
      (see notes below):
      <ul>
        <li>On the left hand menu, choose “Assignments”.</li>
        <li>
          From the list, choose “1. Hello, World!”. In the file upload, drag
          over the .py file you just created and ran, and
        </li>
        <li>click “Submit”.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="using-gradescope">Using Gradescope</h3>

  <p>
    This course will use the on-line
    <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a> system for submitting
    work electronically. An email invitation to the course was sent to your
    email address (we used the one saved for you on CUNYFirst as of Friday,
    29 January).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Open your email and click the links to set up your account.</li>
    <li>
      Once you have your account, click on the “Assignments” menu (left hand
      side of window), and then choose the assignment “1. Hello, World.”
    </li>
    <li>Drag and drop your program onto the submit box.</li>
    <li>
      Each program can be submitted multiple times up to the deadline.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="more-python-turtles">More Python: Turtles</h3>

  <p>
    Now that you have just submitted your first program, let’s try some
    other Python commands. Here’s a quick demo (click the triangle to run
    the program):
  </p>

  <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/22709f8349" width="80%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0"
    marginheight="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Now, let’s write the same program in IDLE:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open up a new file window in IDLE (“File &gt; New File”).</li>
    <li>
      <p>Type into your window:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>import turtle
thomasH = turtle.Turtle()
for i in range(4):
  thomasH.forward(100)
  thomasH.right(90)
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Save your program (“File &gt; Save”).<br />
      <em>Note: Choose a name for your file that is
        <strong>not</strong> turtle.py. When executing the “import turtle”
        statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is
        saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other
        places on the path). So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all
        kinds of errors. To avoid this, name your program something like
        “myTurtle.py” or “program2.py”.</em>
    </li>
    <li>Run your program (using the “Run Module” from the “Run” menu).</li>
    <li>
      Change your program so that it draws a octagon (8-sided polygon).
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Test your program and modify until you have a octagon. When you do,
        add comments at the top of your program:
      </p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>#Name:  ...your name here...
#Date: January 30, 2021
#This program draws a octagon.
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Run your program after editing to make sure you do not have any
        typos.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Log into Gradescope (see notes above). On the left hand menu, choose
      “Assignments”. From the list, choose “2. Octagon”. In the file upload,
      drag the .py file you just created and ran, and click “Submit”.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>A quick overview of the parts of your second program:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Lines that begin with # are ignored by Python– they are comments for
      you to remember what you did and others to follow what’s going on.
    </li>
    <li>
      The line import turtle loads in the built-in turtle graphics drawing
      package. It’s part of all versions of Python but, to keep programs
      small, is not included unless you explicitly import it. In addition to
      built-in packages, there are many others that have been written to
      make Python more useful. We will use both kinds as the semester
      progresses.
    </li>
    <li>
      The line tia = turtle.Turtle() creates a turtle object called tia (you
      can call your turtles almost any combination of letters (and
      underscores and numbers)– we used a name starting with “t” since
      turtle starts with “t”).
    </li>
    <li>
      The next line: for i in range(4): is the first part of a for-loop that
      will repeat the commands indented beneath it 4 times.
    </li>
    <li>
      The turtle class has many functions that you can use for your turtle.
      The next two lines demonstrate two of them:
      <ul>
        <li>tia.forward(150) moves tia forward 150 steps.</li>
        <li>tia.right(90) turns tia to the right 90 degrees.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="more-turtle-commands">More Turtle Commands</h3>

  <p>To review, we introduced the turtle commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>forward()</li>
    <li>left()</li>
    <li>right()</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    as well as importing the turtle package (import turtle) and creating
    (“instantiating”) a turtle (thomasH = turtle.Turtle()).
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many more turtles commands. Over the next couple of classes,
    we will use those in the
    <a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html">turtle chapter</a>
    from the textbook. A
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">complete list of turtle commands</a>
    is part of the Python 3 documentation.
  </p>

  <h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>

  <p>
    If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on
    the programming problems due next week. The
    <a href="assignments.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem
    descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
