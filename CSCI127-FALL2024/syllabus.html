      <h4 id="general-information">General Information</h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> <em>3 hours, 3 credits:</em> This course
        presents an overview of computer science (CS) with an emphasis on
        problem-solving and computational thinking through ‘coding’: computer
        programming for beginners. Other topics include: organization of
        hardware, software, and how information is structured on contemporary
        computing devices. This course is pre-requisite to several introductory
        core courses in the CS Major. The course is also required for the CS
        minor. MATH 12500 or higher is strongly recommended as a co-req for
        intended Majors.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Expectations:</em></strong> Students are expected to learn
        both the material covered in class and the material in the textbook and
        other assigned reading. Completing homework is an essential part of the
        learning experience. Students should review topics from prior courses as
        needed using old notes and books.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Honor Code:</em></strong> Tests, quizzes, programs and homework assignments, must be your
        own work. You are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College’s
        <a
          href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity"
          >Academic Integrity Policy</a
        >:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism,
          cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and
          falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses
          against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed
          to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue
          cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic
          Integrity Procedures.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student
        Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students
        office.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Homework:</em></strong> Programming exercises are posted on
        the class website. They
        reinforce concepts covered in lecture and lab. Note that as the semester
        progresses, the programs will require work on design and programming
        outside of class to complete. To receive full credit for a program, the
        program must perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in
        good style. Programs are submitted via
        <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>. You can miss up to 5
        programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all
        the programming assignments, I will drop the lowest 5 scores).
        <strong><em>No late homework is accepted.</em></strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Lecture Participation:</em></strong> Attending the full class and attempting Quizzes will count towards participation
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>In-Class Quizzes:</em></strong> At every recitation, there
        will be an in-class quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted
        programs, and laboratory exercises.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions as
          well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
        </li>
        <li>
          All quizzes must be taken during class time, and
          <strong>there are no make-up quizzes.</strong> 
        </li>
        <li>
          As suggested by the name, only in-class quizzes taken in class.
          Quizzes taken outside of class will be sanctioned with a grade of 0
          and reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Repeated quizzes taken
          outside of class will result in a failing grade as well as sanctions,
          as outlined in the Academic Integrity Policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Final Exam:</em></strong> The final exam is required. It is
        comprehensive, covering all the material of the course. Sample and past
        exams will be available on the course webpage.
      </p>

      <h4 id="grading-policy">Grading Policy</h4>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Grades:</em></strong> The grading for the course will be
        based on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Problem Sets: 30%</li>
        <li>Quizzes: 28%</li>
        <li>Participation: 7%</li>
        <li>
          Final Exam: 35%
